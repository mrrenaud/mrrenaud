### Hi there 👋

I'm **Renaud Dumont** — tech founder, product-oriented developer, and community builder based in 🇧🇪 Mons, Belgium.

## 🚀 What I Do

I run **[Sparkle.tech](https://www.sparkle.tech)** — a modern software agency building high-quality digital products for ambitious companies.

We don't just ship code.  
We help founders and teams clarify their product vision, structure their roadmap, and build scalable, maintainable software.

## 🛠 Tech I Enjoy

I mostly work with:

- **TypeScript**
- **C#**
- React / React Native
- ASP.NET Core
- Product & system architecture thinking

I care a lot about:
- Clean architecture
- Long-term maintainability
- Developer experience
- Building things that *actually* solve problems

## 🌍 Community

I co-organize **[DevDay](https://devday.be)** — one of the largest developer conferences in Wallonia.  
It’s my way of giving back to the ecosystem that helped me grow.

## 🤖 AI & The Future of Development

I’m particularly interested in how AI is reshaping the way we build software.

Not as a shortcut.  
But as a **multiplier**.

I actively explore:
- AI-assisted development workflows
- LLM-powered product features
- Automation that removes friction for teams
- The evolving role of developers in an AI-augmented world

I believe the best engineers won’t be replaced —  
they’ll be amplified.

## 🎵 Outside of Tech

Sometimes I write code.  
Sometimes I write music.

You can find my tracks:
